## 🌱 Philosophy

> *"The best way to predict the future is to build it."*

I believe in **learning by doing**, creating **practical solutions**, and keeping things **elegantly simple**. Every project is an opportunity to push boundaries and grow.

**My approach:**
- 🎓 Learn in public, fail fast, iterate faster
- 🔓 Privacy-first, open-source when possible
- 🤝 Collaborate, share knowledge, lift others
- ⚡ Build tools that solve real problems
